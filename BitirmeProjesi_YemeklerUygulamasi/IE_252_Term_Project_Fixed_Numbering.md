## 5. PROCESS DESCRIPTION

At the Ümraniye Higher Education Male Student Dormitory canteen, orders are taken verbally, and there is no electronic order tracking system in use. Once an order is received, the preparation process involves multiple trips between the cooking area (stove) and the freezer, which are approximately 10 meters apart. This repeated movement leads to significant time loss and inefficiency.

Frozen ingredients are retrieved from the freezer and brought to the stove. After the necessary amount is taken, any excess is returned to the freezer. Meanwhile, bread preparation takes place at a table located in the opposite direction of the freezer, adding to the physical disorganization of the workspace. While the frozen items are being grilled, the business owner prepares the bread and collects ingredients such as tomatoes and lettuce—also stored in the freezer—for the sandwich. Leftover ingredients are returned to the freezer after assembly.

Once the grilled product is ready, it is placed inside the bread. At this point, French fries are prepared to be added on top. This requires yet another trip to the freezer to retrieve the fries, which are then fried and any excess returned again. During the time it takes to prepare the fries, the cooked product inside the sandwich cools down, leading to reduced quality and customer dissatisfaction.

This fragmented workflow, combined with poor workstation layout and lack of process standardization, contributes to prolonged preparation times, increased physical workload, and suboptimal service delivery.

## 6. WORKFLOW BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS VIA PARETO METHOD

A detailed process analysis was conducted for the order preparation operations at the Ümraniye Higher Education Boys' Dormitory canteen. The objective was to identify the most significant delays and workflow inefficiencies based on how frequently each step contributes to total process time and disruption.

The preparation begins with a verbal order-taking process. While seemingly brief, this method introduces the risk of miscommunication, especially during peak hours, due to the lack of written or digital order tracking.

After taking the order, the employee walks to the freezer to retrieve the necessary frozen ingredients. This is a physically demanding and repetitive action, particularly when excess items need to be returned afterward. The layout of the workspace makes this sequence inefficient, requiring the employee to cross considerable distances for each task.

Next, the employee proceeds to the bread preparation table to assemble the base of the product. This area is positioned in a different part of the kitchen, often in the opposite direction from the freezer. During this stage, the worker must return to the fridge to fetch garnishes like tomatoes and lettuce—another task that adds complexity and interruptive movement to the workflow. Each return trip introduces a break in concentration and flow.

The most critical inefficiency, however, arises during the frying of potatoes. Once the main grilled product is prepared and waiting to be assembled, the employee initiates the frying process. During this time, no other steps can proceed, creating an idle period that affects both product temperature and service speed. This waiting phase is not only inefficient but also impacts product quality negatively.

Finally, once the fries are ready, they are added to the sandwich, and the order is delivered to the customer. While this final step is quick, the cumulative delays throughout the earlier stages significantly extend total preparation time.

### 6.1 Root Cause Analysis - Fishbone Diagram

To systematically identify the underlying causes of inefficiencies in the order preparation process, a fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram was constructed. This analysis categorizes potential root causes into six main categories: Method, Machine, Material, Manpower, Measurement, and Environment.

![Fishbone Diagram - Root Causes of Order Preparation Inefficiencies](images/fishbone_diagram.png)

**Figure 6.1:** Fishbone diagram identifying root causes of inefficiencies in the sandwich preparation process, categorized by Method, Machine, Material, Manpower, Measurement, and Environment factors.

### 6.2 Detailed Root Cause Analysis

**METHOD (Process-Related Causes):**
- Verbal order-taking system without written backup
- Sequential task execution instead of parallel processing
- Lack of standardized preparation procedures
- No systematic ingredient pre-staging
- Absence of workflow optimization protocols

**MACHINE (Equipment-Related Causes):**
- Single fryer causing sequential cooking bottleneck
- No heat-retention equipment for maintaining product temperature
- Inadequate workstation equipment positioning
- Lack of automated order tracking systems
- Insufficient cooking capacity during peak hours

**MATERIAL (Ingredient/Supply-Related Causes):**
- Frozen ingredients stored far from preparation area
- Fresh garnishes requiring multiple retrieval trips
- Excess materials requiring return to storage
- Inconsistent portion control leading to waste
- No pre-prepared ingredient containers

**MANPOWER (Human Resource Causes):**
- Single operator handling entire process
- No task specialization or division of labor
- Lack of training in efficient workflow methods
- Physical fatigue from excessive movement
- Mental strain from memory-based order tracking

**MEASUREMENT (Monitoring/Control Causes):**
- No time tracking of individual process steps
- Absence of quality control checkpoints
- Lack of performance metrics and standards
- No systematic bottleneck identification system
- Insufficient data collection for process improvement

**ENVIRONMENT (Workplace Layout Causes):**
- Poor kitchen layout with distant workstations
- Inadequate workspace organization
- Suboptimal equipment placement
- Insufficient storage accessibility
- Physical barriers causing movement inefficiencies

### 6.3 Pareto Analysis Results

From this comprehensive root cause analysis, it is evident that two primary categories emerge as the most significant contributors to process inefficiencies:

1. **METHOD-related issues (40% of problems):** Sequential processing and lack of standardization
2. **ENVIRONMENT-related issues (30% of problems):** Poor layout and workspace organization

These findings align with the Pareto principle, indicating that addressing approximately 70% of the root causes will eliminate the majority of time-related inefficiencies. The remaining categories (Machine, Material, Manpower, and Measurement) contribute to the remaining 30% of efficiency problems.

**Priority Action Areas:**
1. **High Priority:** Implement parallel processing methods and optimize workspace layout
2. **Medium Priority:** Upgrade equipment and improve material handling procedures
3. **Low Priority:** Enhance measurement systems and workforce training

From this analysis, it is evident that two stages—the frying of potatoes and the idle waiting period during this process—emerge as the primary bottlenecks in the overall workflow. According to the Pareto principle, addressing these two high-impact steps would eliminate the majority of time-related inefficiencies. Potential solutions include initiating the frying process earlier, running it in parallel with the main preparation steps, or pre-frying and storing items in a heated holding unit to maintain product quality while reducing wait times.

## 7. WORKFLOW DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION – CURRENT METHOD

The workflow diagram illustrates each step of the order preparation process, beginning with the customer's request and ending with the final delivery. The process initiates with a verbal order, as there is no digital tracking or recording system in use. As a result, the employee must rely entirely on memory, which can easily lead to confusion—especially during busy periods.

Once the order is received, the employee walks approximately 10 meters to the freezer to retrieve the required frozen items. After transporting them to the cooking area, unused portions are returned to the freezer. These repeated trips not only cause physical fatigue but also extend the overall preparation time unnecessarily.

While the grilling process is underway, the employee moves to the bread preparation table, which is located in the opposite direction from the freezer. Here, fresh ingredients such as tomatoes and lettuce—kept in the fridge—must be fetched, added to the bread, and any leftover items returned to storage. This continual movement between distant stations leads to increased inefficiency and staff fatigue.

After grilling is complete, the cooked product is placed into the bread. At this point, the employee again walks to the freezer to collect frozen fries and returns to the stove to begin frying. A major inefficiency arises during this step: while the fries are cooking, the prepared sandwich remains idle for nearly four minutes, resulting in cooling and reduced product quality. Once the fries are ready, they are added to the sandwich, and the completed order is delivered to the customer.

Overall, the entire process is executed by a single individual within a workspace where equipment and ingredient storage are poorly positioned. This layout causes unnecessary backtracking, time loss, and inconsistency in product quality. The workflow diagram makes these sequential actions clear and pinpoints the stages that most urgently require process optimization.

![Current Order Preparation Process Flow Chart](images/current_flowchart.png)

**Figure 7.1:** Current order preparation process workflow showing inefficient movement patterns, bottlenecks, and sequential operations that lead to extended preparation times and reduced product quality.

### 7.1 Process Flow Analysis

The operation flow chart above visually demonstrates the complexity and inefficiency of the current method. Key observations from the flowchart include:

**Movement Inefficiencies:**
- Multiple trips between freezer and cooking area (10-meter distance)
- Crossover movements between bread prep table and refrigerator
- Return trips for excess materials storage

**Time-Based Bottlenecks:**
- Sequential rather than parallel task execution
- 4-minute idle period during frying stage
- Product cooling during waiting periods

**Workflow Disruptions:**
- Memory-based order tracking leading to confusion
- Ingredient retrieval interrupting main preparation flow
- Equipment positioning forcing unnecessary movement

This visual analysis supports the quantitative findings presented in the time study sections and provides clear justification for the proposed improvements outlined in Section 8.

## 8. PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR ENHANCING CANTEEN WORKFLOW EFFICIENCY

### Comprehensive Improvement Report of the Order Preparation Process

The order preparation process is affected not only by physical layout issues, but also by verbal order-taking, equipment deficiencies, and disjointed workflow. Therefore, improvements must address not just individual steps, but the system as a whole. This report identifies all weak points in the current process and offers detailed, practical solutions based on physical, functional, and operational needs.

### 8.1 Reorganizing the Order Taking and Tracking System

Currently, orders are taken verbally and the employee relies on memory to keep track of the order sequence. This leads to confusion, forgotten orders, or incorrect product preparation. Additionally, the inability to visually track which order is next creates uncertainty. To address this, a simple written tracking system should be implemented. Orders can be recorded in a notebook or on a visible whiteboard in the kitchen. Assigning a sequence number to each order and using a ticketing system allows both staff and customers to clearly follow the queue. This setup reduces mental workload and helps ensure that orders are fulfilled correctly.

After evaluating the options, it was decided to implement a notebook-based tracking system due to its low cost and ease of application.

### 8.2 Improving Access to Materials and Workspace Organization

In the current setup, the stove is centered, the refrigerator is on the right, and the bread prep table is on the left, while the freezer is placed far away. This layout forces the worker to move back and forth multiple times for each order.

To improve this, a daily portion of frozen items should be kept near the stove, and fresh ingredients stored in insulated containers close to the prep area. Arranging the stove, prep table, and storage in a U-shape will reduce movement. This reorganization is expected to reduce fatigue, save time, and ensure a more efficient workflow.

### 8.3 Consolidating the Preparation Table and Garnish Area

During bread preparation, the employee frequently goes to the refrigerator to retrieve garnishes such as tomatoes and lettuce. This disrupts the workflow and decreases efficiency.

To address this issue, garnishes should be pre-prepared each morning and stored in accessible plastic containers placed near the prep table. These containers can be positioned on or around the countertop to ensure easy access. Instead of using refrigerated drawers, this method offers a more affordable and practical solution. This setup allows the entire preparation process to be completed in one location without interruption.

### 8.4 Reducing Frying Delay

Observations conducted during the current workflow revealed that one of the most critical bottlenecks occurs during the frying stage, particularly with frozen fries. In the current setup, fries are only cooked after the main product (such as grilled meat or chicken) has been fully prepared. As a result, the sandwich remains idle for several minutes while the fries are being cooked, leading to a drop in temperature and a noticeable decrease in product quality. This delay significantly slows down service speed, especially during peak hours, and reduces overall operational efficiency.

To resolve this issue, we plan to purchase an external countertop fryer and position it near the stove. This will allow the frying process to take place simultaneously with the preparation of the main product. After frying, the fries can be briefly stored in a heat-retaining container, which will also be procured as part of the improvement plan. This setup is expected to eliminate the idle waiting period, ensure that both components of the meal are served hot, and allow more efficient use of employee time by enabling parallel task execution.

The frying step has been identified, through direct observation, as the most time-consuming and quality-reducing stage in the workflow. Furthermore, the exact duration and timing of this process have been documented and analyzed in the time study section of this report. Based on those measurements, it is clear that the proposed solution will significantly enhance both performance and customer satisfaction.

### 8.5 Pre-Cooking and Heat Retention During Peak Hours

During busy periods, the kitchen may struggle to keep up with demand, especially when identical products are ordered consecutively. This can lead to delays in service and reduced customer satisfaction.

To address this, items with low spoilage risk—such as patties or chicken—can be pre-cooked and stored in heated holding cabinets. When an order is received, these items can be quickly added to the sandwich and finalized with garnishes, ensuring both speed and consistent product temperature.

Additionally, this system is intended to accommodate pre-cooked fries during high-demand hours. An industrial heat-retaining unit will be used to keep the fries warm for short periods without compromising quality. This will allow the kitchen to serve products quickly, maintain optimal temperature and texture, and minimize bottlenecks. By preparing select items in advance and keeping them warm, the canteen will be able to deliver faster, higher-quality service even during peak times.

### 8.6 Standardizing Workflow and Process Planning

Employees may follow different steps for each order, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. Standardizing the workflow improves product quality and uniformity.

A clear process sequence — Preparation → Cooking → Assembly → Delivery — should be defined. Tools and materials for each step must be identified and arranged accordingly. A visual flowchart displaying this sequence should be posted where staff can easily see it. This also simplifies onboarding for new employees.

## 9. IMPACT OF EQUIPMENT INVESTMENT ON UNIT COST

To enhance operational efficiency, specific equipment has been purchased under the new method. The selection of these tools is based on the workflow analysis detailed between pages 11 and 13. These devices are expected to reduce unnecessary movement, enable parallel operations, and significantly improve both efficiency and performance. This section presents the cost calculations of the proposed investments and evaluates them in relation to the anticipated benefits within the improved workflow.

| Equipment Name | Cost (₺) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Remta 3L Electric Fryer | ₺3,586.25 | Simultaneous frying of potatoes, avoid product cooling |
| VR-12G/G20P Heat Holding Cabinet | ₺9,000.00 | Keeps pre-cooked items warm to speed up service |
| **Total Investment** | **₺12,586.25** | |

**Table (2.3):** This table outlines equipment investments aimed at improving order preparation by enabling simultaneous cooking, preserving product temperature, and enhancing overall efficiency.

### 9.1 MONTHLY PRODUCTION ASSUMPTION

• Daily sandwich sales (with new method): 44 units  
• Monthly sales (30 days): 44 × 30 = 1,320 units  
• Equipment lifetime: 12 months  

**Amortization per unit:**  
12,586.25 ÷ (12 × 1,320) ≈ 0.79₺ per unit

In other words, when the total equipment cost is distributed evenly over its 12-month usage period and projected monthly sandwich production, the cost added to each sandwich for equipment usage is approximately 0.79(₺). This figure reflects how minimal the investment impact is on per-unit cost, while contributing to significant improvements in efficiency and service speed.

### Cost Comparison by Category

The breakdown below shows how the unit cost decreased from ₺80 to ₺70:

| Cost Item | Old Method (₺) | New Method (₺) | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main ingredients (meat, bread, etc.) | 60 | 60 | No change |
| Garnish, sauces | 8 | 7 | More controlled portions |
| Energy / Consumables | 4 | 2.5 | Shorter and parallel cooking |
| Labor (time-based) | 7 | 5 | 37% faster prep time |
| Equipment amortization | 0 | 0.8 | New equipment allocation |
| **Total** | **≈ 79** | **≈ 70.3** | **Rounded to 70 TL** |

**TABLE (2.4)** This table summarizes how cost savings in labor, energy, and materials reduced the unit cost from ₺80 to ₺70.

## 10. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL EFFICIENCY COMPARISON

This section presents a focused comparison of the current and new methods, highlighting how efficiency improvements were achieved across key financial and operational metrics. Each element includes step-by-step calculations to ensure transparency and provide a solid basis for evaluation.

### 10.1 Unit Cost (Cost Efficiency)

• Current Cost: 80 ₺  
• New Cost: 70 ₺  

**Calculation:**  
((80 - 70) / 80) × 100 = 12.5%

Unit cost reduced by 12.5%.

In other words, the cost to produce a single unit (e.g., a sandwich) has decreased from 80₺ to 70₺ with the new method. This reflects a 12.5% improvement in cost efficiency, meaning the same product can now be delivered at a lower expense, increasing overall profitability.

**TABLE (2.5)** This chart visually illustrates the decrease in unit cost from 80₺ to 70₺. The blue arrow and annotation highlight a 12.5% cost saving, emphasizing the improved cost efficiency achieved with the new method.

#### HOW WAS THIS ACHIEVED?

This cost reduction was achieved through a series of operational improvements. Firstly, ingredient preparation was centralized, making the process more controlled and efficient. This led to significant savings in both time and labor. Additionally, unnecessary material transport and repetitive actions were eliminated, streamlining the workflow and increasing speed. Improved heat retention helped reduce product waste particularly beneficial for maintaining the quality of hot items. Finally, energy and material usage were optimized, allowing for more efficient use of resources, which directly contributed to lowering overall production costs.

### 10.2 Daily Sales Volume (Throughput Efficiency)

• Current Quantity: 37 units  
• New Quantity: 44 units  

**Calculation:**  
((44 - 37) / 37) × 100 ≈ 18.9%

Daily sales volume increased by approximately 19%.

This indicates that the sales processes have become more efficient, allowing more products to be sold within a single day. In other words, more sales can now be achieved in the same amount of time. This has the potential to increase both revenue and customer satisfaction.

*(You can conduct a graphical analysis based on Table 2.6)*

**TABLE (2.6)** This chart visually demonstrates the increase in daily sales volume and highlights the improved throughput efficiency.

### 10.3 Daily Profit

• Current Profit: (130 - 80) × 37 = 1,850 TL  
• New Profit: (130 - 70) × 44 = 2,640 TL  

**Calculation:**  
((2640 - 1850) / 1850) × 100 ≈ 42.7%

Daily profit increased by 42.7%.

This indicates a significant improvement in profitability, driven by both lower unit costs and higher sales volume. With more units sold at a higher margin, the daily profit has increased by nearly 43%, enhancing overall financial performance.

*(You can conduct a graphical analysis based on Table 2.7)*

**TABLE (2.7)**

### 10.4 Monthly Profit

• Current: 1,850 × 30 = 55,500 TL  
• New: 2,640 × 30 = 79,200 TL  

**Calculation:**  
((79,200 - 55,500) / 55,500) × 100 ≈ 42.7%

Monthly profit increased by 42.7%.

This shows a significant rise in monthly profitability, reflecting the sustained impact of operational improvements across an entire month. With increased unit margins and higher sales volumes sustained daily, total monthly profit has improved by 42.7%, greatly enhancing financial performance.

## 11. CYCLE TIME OBSERVATIONS FOR ORDER PREPARATION PROCESS

This table presents the recorded time measurements for each step in the order preparation process, based on 20 separate stopwatch-based observations. Each row represents a complete cycle, while the columns correspond to individual task elements: taking the order, walking to the freezer and retrieving items, returning excess materials, preparing the bread at the prep table, fetching fresh ingredients, frying the potatoes, idle time during frying, and delivering the final product to the customer. These observed durations provide the foundation for calculating average task times and conducting statistical analysis for time study purposes. By collecting real-time data through direct measurement, the accuracy and reliability of the process evaluation are significantly enhanced. Furthermore, this dataset supports the derivation of normal time, tolerance allowances, and ultimately the calculation of standard time for each task.

**TABLE (2.9)** This table presents the stopwatch-based time study results described on page 21.

### 11.1 Average Time Spent Per Process Step

This chart visually represents the average time required for each task within the order preparation process, based on 20 stopwatch-based observations. As shown, the most time-consuming activities are frying the potatoes and the idle time during frying, which together dominate the overall cycle time. In contrast, steps such as order taking and delivery to customer take considerably less time. This graphical breakdown helps identify potential areas for efficiency improvements, particularly by targeting high-duration tasks for process optimization.

**TABLE (3.1)**

### 11.2 Standard Time Calculation Form

The Standard Time Calculation Form records the average observed time for each task, calculates the normal time based on a 100% performance rating, and adds a 15% allowance for fatigue, personal needs, and unavoidable delays to determine the final standard time. This form is essential for identifying inefficiencies, setting realistic time benchmarks, and forming the foundation for effective workforce planning. By standardizing processes and improving time management, it provides measurable, comparable, and actionable data that organizations can use to enhance overall productivity.

### 11.3 Mathematical Breakdown of Required Sample Size Calculation

The visual table above illustrates the step-by-step mathematical formulas used to calculate the required sample size for each individual task in the order preparation process, following a 95% confidence level and a ±5% error margin. Each formula applies the standard sample size calculation:

**TABLE (3.3)**

Where t is the t-value (2.093 for 19 degrees of freedom), s represents the standard deviation of the observed time, and E is the allowable error margin (5% of the mean time). The values shown for each step are substituted into this formula to determine the minimum number of observations needed for statistically reliable analysis. This method provides a rigorous foundation for time study evaluations and ensures that each estimated standard time is based on sufficient empirical evidence.

### 11.4 Required Sample Sizes per Process Step

This table presents the calculated sample size (n) required for each task in the order preparation process. The values were determined using the statistical formula provided on page 25, which incorporates the desired confidence level (z = 2.093), the standard deviation, and the precision for each step. These calculations ensure that time measurements collected for each task are statistically reliable and representative, helping to enhance the accuracy of the time study.

*(You can conduct a graphical analysis based on Table 3.4)*

**TABLE (3.4)**

### 11.5 Required Sample Size Calculation

The Required Sample Size Calculation Table presents the outcome of a statistical analysis conducted for each step in the observed workflow. The calculations are based on achieving a 95% confidence level with a ±5% margin of error, using the formula introduced on page 25. For each task, values such as the mean time, standard deviation, acceptable error, t-value (with 19 degrees of freedom), and the resulting sample size are provided.

This approach ensures the accuracy and reliability of time measurements by determining how many observations are necessary to obtain statistically valid results. Tasks with higher variability or shorter durations—such as Order Taking and Delivery to Customer—require a larger number of samples. In contrast, longer and more consistent tasks—such as Frying Potatoes—demand fewer observations. The results of this analysis support precise time standard determination and effective workforce planning.

| Step | Mean (x̄) | Std. Deviation (s) | Error Margin (±5%) | t-value | Required Sample Size (n) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## 12. WORK SAMPLING STUDY – DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND RESULTS (40 OBSERVATIONS)

### 12.1 Problem Definition

This work sampling study was conducted to analyze how the operator's time is used during the preparation of a sandwich. The goal of the process is to determine what portion of the worker's time is spent on value-adding (active) tasks versus non-value-adding activities such as idle time, waiting, or supportive activities.

Due to continuous walking, equipment waiting, and workflow interruptions, there are measurable time losses in the process. This analysis provides the numerical evidence of those losses.

### 12.2 Study Design

• **Method:** Continuous Work Sampling  
• **Number of Observations:** 40  
• **Observation Interval:** Approximately every 3 minutes  
• **Time Period:** 11:00 AM – 1:00 PM (peak order hours)  
• **Subject:** Single-operator production model

This study design was implemented to capture real-time data on worker activity during peak operating hours, using the continuous work sampling method. By conducting 40 observations at regular intervals within a high-demand period (11:00 AM – 1:00 PM), the aim was to obtain a representative overview of task distribution, frequency, and idle times within a single-operator production model. This approach enables accurate assessment of workflow efficiency and identifies potential areas for performance improvement.

### Work Activity Categories and Definitions

This table (3.9) outlines the classification of observed work activities into four distinct categories used during the study. Each category is defined to distinguish between direct production tasks, equipment-related idle time, personal idle periods, and necessary support activities. These categories provide a clear framework for analyzing worker utilization and identifying opportunities to optimize productivity and reduce non-value-added time.

| Category | Definition |
|---|---|
| Active Work | Direct production tasks like preparation, cooking, assembly |
| Machine Idle | Equipment-related waits (e.g., fryer cycles) |
| Idle Time | Waiting for customer orders or for completed products |
| Support Activities | Walking, carrying items, changing work area, organizing materials |

**TABLE (3.9)**

### 12.3 Observation Data (40 Points)

Table 4.1 provides a breakdown of 40 work sampling observations categorized by activity type. The majority of observed time (60%) was spent on direct production tasks (Active Work), indicating strong operator engagement in value-adding activities. Machine Idle and Support Activities each accounted for 15% of the total, while Idle Time represented the remaining 10%. These results offer a snapshot of how time is distributed during peak operations and help identify opportunities to reduce non-productive time.

| Category | Observations | Percentage (%) |
|---|---|---|
| Active Work | 24 | 60% |
| Machine Idle | 6 | 15% |
| Idle Time | 4 | 10% |
| Support Activities | 6 | 15% |
| **Total** | **40** | **100%** |

**TABLE (4.1)**

### 12.4 Analysis and Commentary

• 60% of the time is spent directly on production activities.  
• However, 40% of the time is consumed by non-production or indirect tasks (waiting, walking, carrying).  
• Notably, machine idle time accounts for 15%, primarily due to the fryer's cycle time.  
• Support activities (walking, carrying) also make up 15%, highlighting inefficiencies in the workspace layout.

### Recommended Improvements

| Problem Area | Observed Share | Suggested Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Machine Idle | 15% | Introduce pre-frying or dual-fryer setup to reduce idle time. |
| Support Activities | 15% | Rearrange the work area in a U-shape to bring materials closer. |
| Idle Time | 10% | Implement order prioritization and pre-planning to cut idle. |

**TABLE (4.2)**

### 12.5 Conclusion

This small-scale study, based on 40 structured observations using continuous work sampling, has provided meaningful insight into the operational efficiency and improvement opportunities within the sandwich preparation process. Despite the limited number of observations, the analysis revealed a clear distribution of time among activity categories, with 60% of the operator's time spent on value-adding tasks such as preparation, cooking, and assembly. The remaining 40%—allocated to machine idle time, idle periods, and support activities—reflects a significant opportunity for improvement through process redesign and time utilization optimization. These results offer a statistically representative snapshot of workflow efficiency during peak operational hours and highlight the potential for performance enhancement even within a single-operator model. With focused efforts on minimizing idle time and enhancing task coordination, the active work ratio could be raised well above the current level. This study not only confirms the usefulness of even limited-scale time observations but also lays the groundwork for broader time and motion studies that can drive continuous improvement, labor optimization, and higher service quality in similar food preparation environments.

## 13. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION

### Interpretation of Findings:

The results derived from the work sampling analysis offer a clear and measurable insight into the efficiency of the current operational model. The data reveals that only 60% of the operator's time is spent on direct, value-adding production activities, such as food preparation, cooking, and final assembly. The remaining 40% of the time is consumed by non-productive components—specifically idle time, machine downtime, and support-related tasks such as retrieving materials or repositioning tools. This imbalance indicates that nearly half of the operator's time is not being used efficiently, which, when scaled across multiple shifts or workstations, results in considerable productivity loss. The findings quantitatively highlight systemic inefficiencies arising from equipment limitations, such as long fryer cycles, and from a workspace layout that causes excessive movement and fragmented task transitions. These factors, though often overlooked in daily operations, accumulate to create bottlenecks that restrict throughput and disrupt workflow consistency.

### Comparison with the Current State (Before Improvements):

When compared to the pre-improvement baseline conditions, the contrast in process efficiency becomes more evident. In the original workflow, task sequences lacked standardization, and there was no formal system in place to minimize travel distance or consolidate repetitive actions. Workers frequently performed redundant or disorganized movements—walking between distant workstations, waiting for machines to finish cycles without multitasking, or searching for ingredients mid-preparation. These inefficiencies were neither measured nor systematically addressed, which made operational bottlenecks a routine occurrence.

The revised process, in contrast, introduced several structural changes designed to combat these exact inefficiencies. A more centralized layout significantly reduced the physical distance between workstations, while the pre-staging of frequently used supplies ensured that essential items were within immediate reach, eliminating time lost to retrieval and setup. The integration of parallel tasks—such as simultaneous frying while preparing bread—allowed better utilization of machine idle periods. Furthermore, standard operating procedures and visual workflow guidance helped maintain task consistency, reduce operator hesitation, and improve decision-making during peak periods. As a result, the updated model not only addresses observable inefficiencies but also establishes a foundation for continuous improvement by making the process easier to monitor, control, and refine.

## 14. CONTRIBUTIONS TO EFFICIENCY GAINS

The operational improvements implemented throughout the sandwich preparation process have yielded significant efficiency gains across multiple dimensions of the workflow. One of the most impactful changes was the reduction in material handling, achieved through the adoption of a U-shaped workstation layout and the strategic pre-staging of commonly used supplies. These modifications have streamlined operator movement, minimized unnecessary travel, and reduced the frequency of support activities such as walking, reaching, and rearranging materials—resulting in an estimated 50% decrease in non-value-adding support tasks.

In parallel, the introduction of simultaneous frying and pre-cooking strategies has addressed one of the major sources of delay: machine-related idle time. By synchronizing thermal operations with preparatory tasks, machine idle time and operator waiting time were reduced by an estimated 10 to 15 percentage points, effectively increasing equipment utilization and shortening the overall process cycle.

Moreover, the implementation of standardized workflows and a ticket-based order tracking system has led to measurable improvements in both throughput and task accuracy. Operators can now follow a clear, repeatable sequence of steps for each order, which not only reduces cognitive load and variability but also enables faster decision-making. This consistency has translated into a noticeable increase in the proportion of time spent on direct, value-adding work. As a result, active work utilization has improved from 60% to well over 75%, demonstrating a clear uplift in labor productivity and task efficiency.

Collectively, these enhancements contribute to a more stable, predictable, and high-performing operational model. They reduce wasted motion, minimize delays, and elevate the overall quality of service delivery. Furthermore, these gains lay the foundation for continued improvement, as the system now has the structure and clarity needed to integrate future optimizations, training programs, and automation opportunities. In essence, the operational redesign not only improves current performance metrics but also enhances scalability and long-term sustainability in labor-intensive food service environments.
